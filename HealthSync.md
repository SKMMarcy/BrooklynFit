# Health Sync

## Mission Statement
At HealthSync, our mission is to empower individuals in Brooklyn on their fitness journey by fostering a community-driven platform focused on exercise events, education, and personal growth.

## Who We Serve
We cater to beginners in Brooklyn who are looking to embark on their fitness journey, value community, and do not know where to start.

## Product Overview
HealthSync is an application where users can sign up to create and browse exercise events anywhere in Brooklyn. Each event  created will have a  location, time and description of the event. Event creators are incentivized to be detailed in their event description. Users can find routes to the location, and choose to join and receive updates on the events they joined. Each event will have tags allowing users to filter events by tags such like walking, biking or yoga in the search engine. This page will allow beginners to quickly and easily find groups and activities to aid their fitness journey.  There will also be a secondary educational page where users can find a mirage of exercises with an in-depth search capability of filtering by cardio,  weighted exercises, calisthenics, whether gym equipment or setup is needed. This will provide the best set of exercises suited for the user. If a user favorites an exercise, they will be more likely to see event posts that will likely incorporate that exercise. There will also be a page for note taking and journaling, where users can take notes on exercises or journal on the progress for their fitness journey.

## Summary
According to the New York Department of Health, Brooklyn has the highest number of obese people than any other borough (Environment and Health Data Portal, 2020). We also find that many individuals struggle to start their fitness journey, this can be due to lack motivation or knowledge. Based on studies done by Iowa State University, Intrinsic motivation comes from finding joy or satisfaction in the activity itself. If you enjoy exercising, especially with others, it transforms the workout into an enjoyable social experience, increasing the likelihood of long-term commitment (Iowa State University Department of Kinesiology, 2021) .

## The Problem
Brooklyn faces a distinctive challenge with obesity rates higher than most other areas in New York City. HealthSync recognizes the unique barriers that individuals in Brooklyn encounter when trying to maintain their health and wellness. A significant issue is the lack of cohesive community support and motivation, which are crucial for embarking on and sustaining fitness journeys. Many residents struggle to find reliable and relevant information that resonates with their lifestyle and environment, making it difficult to effectively manage weight, monitor caloric intake, and maintain regular fitness routines.

## Solution
If individuals find themselves in the company of others striving to enhance their well-being, then it will foster greater motivation to continue their health journey. If residents of neighborhoods like Brooklyn, where the pace of life is brisk and resources are often limited, have access to a unified and user-friendly platform like HealthSync, then they will be able to gain a clearer understanding of their health metrics and make more informed decisions about their fitness and nutritional needs. This platform is not just about tracking health data; it’s designed to foster a sense of community and encouragement. If HealthSync successfully cultivates a virtual community where individuals feel connected and can share their experiences, challenges, and successes, then it will create a supportive environment that is essential for motivation. This aspect of community is particularly crucial in Brooklyn, where communal ties and shared experiences significantly influence lifestyle changes. Therefore, if HealthSync integrates these elements effectively, then it will not only serve as a comprehensive health tracking tool but also as a catalyst for fostering lasting health and wellness transformations in Brooklyn's diverse communities.
